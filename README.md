# more-than-dotfiles (WIP)

this is just a script to automate the setup of my basic/template development and home environment.

it includes:
- theme setup (catppuccin mocha wherever possible, including refind bootloader and tty)
- hyprland+waybar setup
- bash setup
- git setup
- environment variables (for development and others)
- neovim setup
- other dotfiles for common applications
- nvidia setup
- secure boot
- qemu/virt-manager setup
- plymouth

i'm currently using archlinux, and this script makes use of pacman and the aur.
if you use vanilla/minimal archlinux, or a light/minimal arch-based distro,
and have a container-oriented workflow, this might be useful to you, so feel free to use it i guess.
but I can't guarantee it works for you. and if you do use it, make sure to read and modify the scripts 
as this is tailored towards my personal workflow.
