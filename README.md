# devstuff (WIP)

this is just a script to setup my basic/template development environment.

i distrohop a lot and use multiple OS, most of which are immutable/image-based.

if you use silverblue or another image-based or container-oriented distribution,
this might be useful to you, so feel free to use it i guess. but I can't
guarantee it works for you.
