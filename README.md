# more-than-dotfiles (WIP)

this is just a script to automate the setup of my basic/template development and home environment.

it includes:
- bash setup
- git setup
- environment variables (for development and others)
- template neovim and vim setup
- other dotfiles for common applications
- (*wip*) flatpak (downloads, settings, and remotes)
- (*wip*) fedora silverblue setup (rpm-ostree overlays and overrides)
- (*possible wip*) fedora silverblue rebase to a ublue image

i distrohop a lot and use multiple OS, most of which are immutable/image-based.

if you use silverblue or another image-based or container-oriented distribution,
this might be useful to you, so feel free to use it i guess. but I can't
guarantee it works for you. and if you do use it, make sure to read and modify the scripts 
as this is tailored towards fedora silverblue, and my personal workflow.
